# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part of tictactoe ws getting my program to run, when evaluating through my code orginally, I also found it a bit confusing as to how the prgram looped through the program. When i went through and evaluated my thought process i was able to battle through indentation errors. 
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
You would add a computer player to the game by making a get random move function. While doing this, the random move would place an a marker in a random place simulating a real player.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
